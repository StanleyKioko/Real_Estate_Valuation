# Real_Estate_Valuation
In this project I am carrying out Data analysis to answer some questions and make a machine learning algorithm that predicts the price of a House
Given the following variables
1.X1 transaction date:The   transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)

2.X2 house age:The house age   (unit: year)

3.X3 distance to the nearest MRT station:The distance   to the nearest MRT station (unit: meter)

4.X4 number of convenience stores:The number of   convenience stores in the living circle on foot

5.X5 latitude:The geographic   coordinate, latitude (unit: degree)

6.X6 longtitude:The geographic   coordinate, longitude (unit: degree)

7.Y house price of unit area: The house price of unit  
 area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit,
1 Ping = 3.3   meter squared) for example, 29.3 = 293,000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping

I used the follwing Machine learning algorithms
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
LightGBM
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
